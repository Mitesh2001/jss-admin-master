                    All Fees are due by the 1st of January. If all fees are not paid by the 1st January, the lapsed membership nomination fee will be incurred. If there is a case of genuine hardship, contact the Treasurer/Membership Officer before the renewal date closes to organise a payment plan/arrangement. You must remit both branch fees as well as range fees as applicable to your section(s) at the time of renewal.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Club support of any firearm(s) is only valid if you are a current financial member. To be classified as a financial member, you must include payment of your Range Fees – where applicable (Branch By-Law Article 2, Section 2).
                </p>

                <p>
                    All fees that are paid and processed in good faith are not refundable – in the exception of miscalculation or processing error on the part of the Club (Branch By-Law Article 2, Section 2, 1E).
